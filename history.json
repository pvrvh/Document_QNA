    "answer": "\ud83e\udd16 AI-Generated Answer:\n\nThe complexity of the code is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the code for binary search, we can infer that the time complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the code divides the search space in half at each step, which is a characteristic of logarithmic time complexity.\n\n[Source: code for binary search.txt] \n\nNote: The context does not provide a direct answer to the question, but the code itself suggests a logarithmic time complexity.",
